// Three Design Pattern Types: Design Patterns, Coding Patterns, and
// Antipatterns

// 1. Design Patterns: Focuses on JS implementations, as some design patterns
//    are not as relevant to JS (since it is a dynamic, not strongly typed,
//    programming language). Most of this material is recycled from "Design
//    Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" -- notably
//    composition is preferred over class-inheritence here (p.4).  Examples:
//    singleton, factory, decorator, observer.

// 2. Coding Patterns: The MAIN TOPIC of this book -- "good practices related to
//    the unique features of the language"

// 3. Antipatterns: Common techniques/approaches that end up causing more
//    problems than solutions.

// 4. Strict Mode: You should get into the habit of using "use strict" -- strict
//    mode, which "removes features from the language, making programs simpler
//    and less error-prone" -- note that running JSLint in the background will
//    also enforce strict mode compliance
