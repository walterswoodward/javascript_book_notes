# Instructions

Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

1. Since this is an "unsorted linked list", this implementation really only needs a head, with new entries placed inserted at the top of the LinkedList regardless of their value.
