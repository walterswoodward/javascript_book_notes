# cracking-the-coding-interview

Welcome to cracking-the-coding-interview! This repository serves as a place that I can record my notes while reading through "Cracking the Coding Interview" (6th Edition) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. 

## Citations

Where approprate I have added a citation at the top of the file to give credit to authors of code that I have utilized. Most of my notes are a combination of my own intial solutions combined with additional notes and comments after studying McDowell's solutions (translated over from Java to Javascript). 

## Supplemental Folders

In addition to the problems McDowell provides you may also find "supplemental" folders which contain additional problems I considered while reading.
