# checkPermutation

## Instructions

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

## Considerations

1. What should be returned if both input strings are empty?
2. Can we assume that each of the characters in the string are alphabetical letters or do other symbols/numbers need to be considered or removed?
3. Is whitespace considered a character or should it be ignored?
4. Should this function be case sensitive or insensitive?
