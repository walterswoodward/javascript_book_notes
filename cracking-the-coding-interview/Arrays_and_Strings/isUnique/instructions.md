# IsUnique

## Instructions 

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

## Clarification
1. Is the string a ASCII or Unicode string?
2. We will assume extended ASCII characters (256). Another possibility would be standard ASCCI characters (128). If you have a Unicode string, then things can get a little more tricky!

## Edge Cases
1. If you just need to confirm if all characters are unique, then you can include a edge case that returns false if the input string is longer than the number of characters (256 assuming extended ASCII characters) in the set.
1. Will edge case be needed if the string is empty?
