# javascript_book_notes
A repository for my notes on javascript related texts.

## Structure

In addition to this README, each folder (representing one of the books I am reading), contains a README with a citation and any other useful information. Note that these notes are primarily written for me as a quick reference tool for JavaScript books I am reading.
